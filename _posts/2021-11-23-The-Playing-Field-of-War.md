I ventured out on the playing field<br>
of war and infinite pain.<br>
The hell I saw was beyond compare,<br>
fallen comrades everywhere.<br>

Always heros' deaths untold,<br>
the war was just a lie.<br>
Everyday I feel the pain<br>
and all I think is why?<br>

Why do we choose to go to war?<br>
I ake for answer, where none makes sense.<br>
Fight for freedom, fight for us,<br>
fear the whom, not the whys<br>

Broken glass and shattered dreams<br>blood polluting our water streams<br>Big man, small men, tiny man<br>the violence of supremes<br>

Lost on those who rattle loud<br>
are lives taken, lost and drowned<br>lives among the crowd<br>
of kin whose fears born hate<br>

Anger fosters the simple mind<br>fooled to take the bait<br>
blind devotion until it's too late.<br>Please stop, breath, and wait.<br>

Please hear this cry to<br>
heed no call to arms.<br>Your worth more alive<br>than a billion shining stars<br>
