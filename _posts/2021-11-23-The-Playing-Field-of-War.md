title: The Playing Field of War
---

I ventured out on the playing field 
of war and infinite pain.
The hell I saw was beyond compare,
fallen comrades everywhere.

Always heros' deaths untold,
the war was just a lie.
Everyday I feel the pain
and all I think is why?

Why do we choose to go to war?
I ake for answer, where none makes sense.
Fight for freedom, fight for us,
fear the whom's, not the why's

Lost on those who rattle loud
is lives taken,
lives drowned among the crowd
of men whose fears manifest in hate

Anger which takes the bait
blind devotion until it's too late.
Please hear this cry to
heed no call to arms.
